## Description

A robust backend API built with NestJS, GraphQL, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL. Features include JWT-based authentication and CRUD operations for managing departments and sub-departments.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** NestJS
- **API:** GraphQL
- **ORM:** TypeORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Features

- **Authentication:** Secure user login using JWT.
- **Authorization:** Protected GraphQL resolvers/mutations.
- **Department Management:** Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for departments.
- **Sub-Department Management:** Support for hierarchical data structures (departments containing sub-departments).
- **Validation:** Input validation for GraphQL operations.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL Server
- Git

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

```env
# Application Port
PORT=3000

# Database Configuration
DB_TYPE=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME=3600s # e.g., 1 hour

# Add any other environment-specific variables here
```

**Important:** Ensure `your_strong_jwt_secret` is a complex, unique string and kept confidential.

## Database Setup

1.  **Ensure PostgreSQL is running.**
2.  **Create a database** with the name specified in your `.env` file (`DB_DATABASE`).
3.  **Run TypeORM migrations** (if applicable) or synchronize the schema:
    - TypeORM synchronization (for development only) is typically handled by NestJS based on your `ormconfig.js` or module configuration (`synchronize: true`). **Caution:** Do not use `synchronize: true` in production.
    - For production, you would typically generate and run migration files:
      ```bash
      # Example commands (may vary based on your setup)
      npm run typeorm migration:generate -- -n InitialMigration
      npm run typeorm migration:run
      ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    # or
    yarn start:dev
    ```

    The application will be running on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `http://localhost:3000`).

2.  **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Run in production mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run start:prod
    ```

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the GraphQL Playground in your browser:

`http://localhost:<PORT>/graphql` (replace `<PORT>` with your application's port)

The Playground provides an interactive environment to explore the GraphQL schema, run queries, and execute mutations.

### Example Operations

_(Refer to the GraphQL Schema section in the original prompt or explore via the Playground for detailed operations like `login`, `createDepartment`, `getDepartments`, etc.)_

## Testing

Run the test suite using:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

_(Add details about specific test types if available, e.g., unit, integration, e2e)_

**Testing Checklist:**

- Authentication flow (login, token verification)
- CRUD operations for Departments and SubDepartments
- Input validation checks
- Error handling for invalid operations or data
- Performance under load (optional)

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment on platforms like Render.com.

**Requirements:**

- A provisioned PostgreSQL database accessible by the deployment environment.
- Configuration of environment variables (as listed in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section) within the deployment platform's settings.
- Build command: `npm run build` (or `yarn build`)
- Start command: `npm run start:prod` (or `yarn start:prod`)

_(Add platform-specific instructions if necessary)_

## Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing:** User passwords must be securely hashed (e.g., using bcrypt) before storing.
- **JWT Security:** Protect your `JWT_SECRET` and consider using appropriate expiration times (`JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME`). Implement refresh token strategies for better security.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- **Input Sanitization/Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.). TypeORM and class-validator help, but diligence is required.
- **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS in production.
- **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

_(Add other relevant security points like CORS configuration, helmet.js usage, etc.)_
